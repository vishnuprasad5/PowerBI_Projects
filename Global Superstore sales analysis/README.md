The project encompassed several key steps to achieve this goal:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Initiated the project by meticulously cleaning and preparing the dataset. Through careful examination, we addressed missing values, standardized data formats, and refined column names, ensuring that the dataset was accurate and coherent.

Segmentation Visualization:

Utilizing advanced visualization techniques, we segmented the data into distinct categories, namely country, region, and market. This segmentation provided stakeholders with a nuanced perspective of the sales landscape, enabling them to make informed decisions based on specific geographical contexts.

Shipping Analysis:

One pivotal aspect of the project involved dissecting shipping information based on ship mode. Employing dynamic visualizations, we showcased the distribution of shipping percentages across different modes, such as Standard and Express. This insight unveiled valuable patterns in shipping preferences.

Geographical Sales Insights:

Our analysis extended to the geographical dimension, where we generated a comprehensive report on sales across various levels: city, state, region, and market. Through visually engaging maps, we presented a clear depiction of sales trends, empowering stakeholders to comprehend the performance of the store in different geographic areas.

Interactive Reporting:

To enhance stakeholder engagement and data exploration, we crafted an interactive report. This report seamlessly integrated segmented visuals, shipping analysis, and geographical sales insights, enabling stakeholders to delve deeper into the data and gain actionable insights.

The culmination of this project resulted in a comprehensive and interactive report that catered to the stakeholders' requirements for detailed sales transaction analysis. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities and employing meticulous data handling, we successfully transformed raw data into meaningful insights, empowering our stakeholders to make well-informed business decisions based on a thorough understanding of sales dynamics across diverse dimensions
